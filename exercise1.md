I chose Python application. Linting can be handled with Ruff or Pylint. Most popular tool for testing is pytest. It has powerful fixtures and plugins. Fixtures are reusable pieces of setup code that prepare the environment for your tests. For building, Python projects use tools like pip and setuptools for packaging.
For CI pipelines there is for example GitLab CI/CD, Azure Pipelines and CircleCI. GitLab CI/CD is integrated directly into GitLab's platform. It has excellent Docker support and built-in container registry. Azure Pipelines is part of Azure DevOps. It offers both cloud-hosted and self-hosted agents, integrates with Azure services, and provides free build minutes for open-source projects. Works well with repositories on GitHub, Azure Repos, or other Git providers. CircleCI is cloud-based CI/CD platform known for its speed and being developer friendly. It offers powerful caching mechanisms, Docker support, and parallel execution.
I would use cloud-based environment for this setup, because the example team/company is relatively small. Cloud-based solutions are easier to setup, has automatic scaling and low maintenance requirements. It would be better for the team to focus on development rather than infrastructure. However, if the project would have some special requirements like the need for a graphics card to run tests, strict security requirements or just want to avoid per-minute billing costs with heavy CI usage, you might want to use the self-hosted environment.
It would be good to know at least if there are compliance or data residency requirements, what is the expected CI usage volume and does the application need access to internal services.
